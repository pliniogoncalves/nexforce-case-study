API Endpoints
HubSpot API reference
HubSpot API reference
HubSpot’s developer platform is a core part of our mission to empower organizations to
grow better
. Our APIs are designed to enable teams of any shape or size to build robust integrations that help them customize and get the most value out of HubSpot.
All HubSpot APIs are
built using REST conventions
and designed to have a predictable URL structure. They use many standard HTTP features, including methods (
POST
,
GET
,
PUT
,
DELETE
) and error response codes.
All HubSpot API calls are made under
https://api.hubapi.com
and all responses return standard JSON.
In this section of the docs site, you'll find lists of all available endpoints for a given API, along with interactive code blocks for building requests. For walkthroughs of basic usage for these APIs, check out the
API guides
.
Setting up
There are several ways to build integrations with HubSpot:
To build an internal integration for an individual HubSpot account (e.g., you want to build an app that can access and edit only authorized parts of your account to share or integrate with other parts of your organization), create a
private app
.
If you're looking to create a public app that can be installed across multiple HubSpot accounts, you should
create a developer account
. A developer account is where you create HubSpot apps, each authenticated with OAuth and provided with a configurable set of features and permissions. You can also use your developer account to
create test accounts
, monitor app status and performance, or publish apps to the HubSpot App Marketplace.
Learn more about the
different types of apps and how to build them
.
Client libraries
Client libraries are designed to help you interact with the HubSpot APIs with less friction. They are written in several different languages and help bridge the gap between your app and HubSpot’s APIs. Each client library provides functions to access HubSpot's APIs so you don't need to know the exact URL and HTTP method to use for each API call, leaving you more time to focus on building your app.

Using the documentation
Each set of API endpoints includes reference documentation that details the available parameters and provides example requests in multiple languages, and a guide that walks you through the functionality of each endpoint. A link to the corresponding guide for an API will be included at the top of each page for easy navigation.
In the reference documentation for a given API, several options are available to help you test out a given endpoint:
Above the
Request
code block for each endpoint, you can click
Test call
to make test calls directly from the page.
You can paste in an OAuth access token if you're building a
public app
, or a private app access token if you're building a
private app
.
Click
Send request
to make a call to your app with any test parameters that you populate on the left side of the page.
At the top of API reference pages, a
Run in Postman
button is displayed when the API is available in
HubSpot's Postman collection
. Learn more about
using Postman
to make API requests to HubSpot.
When you're ready to implement an API in your integration, you can consult the documentation about general app development, including
authentication
and
listing apps on the App Marketplace
. You'll also find guides for
building UI extensions (BETA)
and working with the
developer projects framework (BETA)
.
Building on HubSpot's CMS
While the API reference documentation includes information about using HubSpot's CMS APIs, such as the
pages API
, you'll find the full set of CMS developer documentation at
https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms
. This includes guides that walk through building various CMS assets as well as reference documentation for HubL.
Support and community resources
Get your questions answered, make connections, and share your insights by joining HubSpot’s growing

Apps
Private apps
Private apps
Private apps
Private apps allow you to use HubSpot's APIs to access specific data from your HubSpot account. You can authorize what each private app can request or change in your account, which will generate an access token that's unique to your app.
You must be a
super admin
to access private apps in your HubSpot account.
Please note:
Private apps do not support custom timeline events. Webhooks are
supported in private apps
, but subscriptions cannot be edited programmatically via an API, and must instead be edited in your private app settings.
If you plan on building an app using custom timeline events, you should create a public app instead. Learn more about the
differences between private and public apps
.
Create a private app
In your HubSpot account, click the
settings icon
in the main navigation bar.
In the left sidebar menu, navigate to
Integrations
>
Private Apps
.
Click
Create private app
.
On the
Basic Info
tab, configure the details of your app:
Enter your app's
name
.
Hover over the placeholder logo and click the
upload icon
to upload a square image that will serve as the logo for your app.
Enter a
description
for your app.
Click the
Scopes
tab.
At the top of the page, click
Add new scope
.
In the right panel, select the
checkbox
for each scope you want your private app to be able to access.
You can also search for a specific scope using the
Find a scope
search bar. You can review a full list of available scopes in
this reference article
.
Click
Update
when you're done adding scopes. If you later decide that your app requires additional scopes, you can also configure them after your app is created.
Review the scopes you've selected for your app. If you decide your app does not require a specific scope, you can click
Delete
next to that scope to remove it. You can also click
Summary of selected scopes
to view a breakdown of your app's scopes and the associated access granted for each one.
To subscribe to events triggered by changes to CRM objects in your account, you can set up webhook subscriptions for your private app:
At the top of the page, Click the
Webhooks
tab.
Under
Target URL
, enter the
URL
that HubSpot will make a
POST
request to when events trigger.
Click
Create subscription
.
In the right panel, select the
object types
that you want to subscribe to, then select the
events
associated with those objects (e.g., created, merged, deleted, etc.) that will trigger HubSpot to send a request to the endpoint you configured.
If you select an object type that requires additional scopes you haven't authorized, you'll be prompted to add those scopes to your app.
If you select
Property changed
for the event type, you can then select any of the associated object properties that you want to subscribe to changes for.
Click
Subscribe
.
If you don't want your webhook subscriptions to be active immediately, or if you want to delete a subscription you mistakenly created, you can hover over the webhook and manage its status, unsubscribe to delete it, or review the subscription details. Learn more about using webhook subscriptions in a private app in
this article
.
After you're done configuring your app, click
Create app
in the top right.
In the dialog box, review the info about your app's access token, then click
Continue creating
.
Once you've created your app, you can start making API calls using the app's access token. If you need to edit your app's info or change its scopes, click
Edit app
in the top right of the app details page.
Make API calls with your app's access token
Please note:
Private apps will lose access to scopes when your HubSpot account is downgraded and loses access to functionality. For example, if your account does not have access to HubDB, your private app will not have access to the HubDB scope.
Private app access tokens will be updated to reflect available scopes in your HubSpot account and what you configured for the private app, but the token string itself will not change.
To start making API calls, navigate to the details page of your app.
In your HubSpot account, click the
settings icon
in the main navigation bar.
In the left sidebar menu, navigate to
Integrations
>
Private apps
.
Click the
name
of your app.
Click the
Auth
tab, click
Show token
to reveal your access token. Click
Copy
to copy the token to your clipboard.
You can then paste the access token to provide it to your developers, or use it yourself as you develop your app. When making a call to one of the HubSpot API endpoints, set the value of the
Authorization
field to
Bearer [YOUR_TOKEN]
. For example, if you're making a call to the
Contacts API
using Node.js and
axios
, the request would look like the following:
Copy code snippet
axios.get(
  'https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts',
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_TOKEN}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  },
  (err, data) => {
    // Handle the API response
  }
);
1
axios
.
get
(
2
'https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts'
,
3
{
4
headers
: {
5
Authorization
:
`Bearer ${
YOUR_TOKEN
}`
,
6
'Content-Type'
:
'application/json'
,
7
},
8
},
9
(
err
,
data
)
=>
{
10
// Handle the API response
11
}
12
);
Private app access tokens are implemented on top of OAuth, so you can also make authenticated calls with your access token using one of HubSpot's client libraries. For example, if you're using the
Node.js client library
, you can instantiate an OAuth client by passing in your app's access token:
Copy code snippet
const hubspotClient = new hubspot.Client({ accessToken: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN });
xxxxxxxxxx
const
hubspotClient
=
new
hubspot
.
Client
({
accessToken
:
YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
});
Please note:
If you
remove the user
who originally created a private app, any API calls that previously used the app's access token will fail with a
result
of
"USER_DOES_NOT_HAVE_PERMISSIONS"
. If this issue occurs, it's recommended that you follow
the instructions in the section below
to rotate your access token.
If you mistakenly removed the user from your account,
adding them back
will also fix the issue.
View private app access token information
To view information about a private app's access token, such as the Hub ID and scopes associated with the token, make a
POST
request to
/oauth/v2/private-apps/get/access-token-info
. In the request body, include your access token:
Copy code snippet
// POST request response body
{
  "tokenKey": {{accessToken}}
}
xxxxxxxxxx
4
1
// POST request response body
2
{
3
"tokenKey"
: {{
accessToken
}}
4
}
The response will include information about the user who created the token, the Hub ID of the account, the private app ID, and the scopes associated with the token.
Copy code snippet
// Example response for GET request to /oauth/v2/private-apps/get/access-token-info
{
  "userId": 123456,
  "hubId": 1020304,
  "appId": 2011410,
  "scopes": ["oauth", "crm.schemas.companies.write"]
}
xxxxxxxxxx

"userId"
:
123456
,

"hubId"
:
1020304
,

"appId"
:
2011410
,
6
"scopes"
: [
"oauth"
,
"crm.schemas.companies.write"
]

}
Rotate your access token
If you access token is lost or otherwise compromised, you can rotate the token. A new access token will be created and the original access token will expire.
In your HubSpot account, click the
Settings
page in the main navigation bar.
Navigate to
Integrations
>
Private Apps
.
Click the
name
of your private app.
Next to your access token, click
Rotate
:
If your token is compromised and you want to immediately revoke access, click
Rotate and expire now
.
If there's no imminent threat to your token, it's still recommended that you rotate your token every six months. If you're ready to initiate a regular rotation of your token, click
Rotate and expire later
, which will trigger an expiration of the token in 7 days.
If your app is ready to transition earlier, you can click
Expire now
.
If you decide you need more time, you can click
Cancel rotation
, which will cancel the expiration of the original token and revoke the new access token.
HubSpot will also send email notifications to
super admins
with reminders about access token rotation status, as well as other related alerts. Super admins in your HubSpot account will receive notifications for the following events and reminders:
A super admin initiated a rotation (either immediately or scheduled for 7 days from now).
A super admin canceled a pending rotation.
A super admin opted to expire an access token immediately by clicking
Expire now
instead of waiting 7 days for the token to expire.
The app's access token is about to expire in 24 hours.
The app's access token has been rotated and expired after 7 days.
If you haven't rotated your access token in over 180 days, super admins will also receive a reminder email to rotate your app's access token.
View API call logs
To review the API calls your app has made in the past 30 days:
On the details page of your app, click the
Logs
tab.
Review and filter your private app API calls:
Click the
Method
and
Response
dropdown menus to filter your historical API calls by request method or response code.
Click the
start date
or
end date
dropdown menus to narrow your call logs to a specific time range.
You can also search for specific calls by URL in the
Search by request URL
search box.
Please note:
HubSpot does not store the request body, request URL parameters, or response payload of successful API calls in the logs for private apps. If you want to track this data, or you want to store log data from more than 30 days ago, it's recommended that you maintain an external log of your app's historical calls.
To export the API call logs, click
Export logs (CSV)
. Then, specify a
date range
(up to the past 30 days) and click
Export
.
In the pop-up box, select the
date range
of API calls you want to export and click
Export
. You will receive an email with a download link when the export is ready.
Private app limits
You can create up to 20 private apps in your HubSpot account. Each private app is subject to
HubSpot's API usage guidelines
. The number of calls your private app can make is based on your account subscription and whether you've purchased the API add-on:
Product Tier
Per 10 Seconds
Per Day
Private Apps
(Any Hub)Free and Starter
100 / private app
250,000 / account
(Any Hub)Professional
190 / private app
625,000 / account
(Any Hub)Enterprise
190 / private app
1,000,000 / account
Private Apps with
API Limit Increase
(Any Hub)Free, Starter, Professional, and Enterprise
200 / private app
1,000,000 / account on top of your base subscription, for each limit increase. You can purchase a maximum of two API limit increase.
If you have both a Starter and Professional plan, limits for the higher tier (Professional) apply to your account.
You can make a
GET
request to
/account-info/v3/api-usage/daily/private-apps
to review the daily API usage for all private apps in your HubSpot account. Learn more about using the
account information API
.
Please note:
Purchasing an API Limit Increase will increase the maximum number of requests you can make to the
associations API
to 1,000,000 daily requests and 200 requests per 10 seconds, but these limits
cannot
be increased further with an additional API Limit Increase purchase.
Delete a private app
When you delete one of your private apps, its access token will be permanently revoked and you'll no longer be able to use it to make API calls.
To delete an app:
In your HubSpot account, click the
settings icon
in the main navigation bar.
Click the
name
of your private app.
At the top of the page, click the
Auth
tab.
At the bottom of the page, click
Delete [name of your app]
.
In the dialog box, type the name of your app to confirm its deletion, then click
Delete
.
